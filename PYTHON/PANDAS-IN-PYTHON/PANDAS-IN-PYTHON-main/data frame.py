#DataFrames:

#Data sets in Pandas are usually multi-dimensional tables, called DataFrames.

#Series is like a column, a DataFrame is the whole table.

#Example
#Create a DataFrame from two Series:

import pandas as pd

data = {
  "calories": [420, 380, 390],
  "duration": [50, 40, 45]
}

myvar = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(myvar)
