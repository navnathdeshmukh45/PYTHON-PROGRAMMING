#What is Pandas?
#Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.

#It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

#The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

#Why Use Pandas?
#Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.

#Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.

#Relevant data is very important in data science.

#:}
#Data Science: is a branch of computer science where we study how to store, use and analyze data for deriving information from it.

#What Can Pandas Do?
#Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:

#Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
#What is average value?
#Max value?
#Min value?
#Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.

#Where is the Pandas Codebase?
#The source code for Pandas is located at this github repository https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas




#Installation of Pandas
#If you have Python and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of Pandas is very easy.

#Install it using this command:

#C:\Users\Your Name>pip install pandas
#If this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has Pandas installed like, Anaconda, Spyder etc.

import  pandas
#Once Pandas is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import keyword:

import pandas
#Now Pandas is imported and ready to use.


#Pandas as pd
#Pandas is usually imported under the pd alias.

#alias: In Python alias are an alternate name for referring to the same thing.

#Create an alias with the as keyword while importing:

import pandas as pd
#Now the Pandas package can be referred to as pd instead of pandas.

#Example
import pandas as pd

mydataset = {
  'cars': ["BMW", "Volvo", "Ford"],
  'passings': [3, 7, 2]
}

myvar = pd.DataFrame(mydataset)

print(myvar)



#Checking Pandas Version
#The version string is stored under __version__ attribute.

#Example
import pandas as pd

print(pd.__version__)
